mt is a lightweight media thumbnailer. it aims to be a simple and fast alternative to outlayers awesome [Video Contact Sheet](http://p.outlyer.net/vcs/)

## Download

you can download the latest version [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/mutschler/mt.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/mutschler/mt/releases/latest) from [githubs release page](https://github.com/mutschler/mt/releases/latest) alternatively you can install `mt` from source as descibed down below

## Installation from Source

`mt` uses depends on ffmpeg's libraries, so you'll need those installed and then run:

```
go get github.com/mutschler/mt
go install github.com/mutschler/mt
```

if you'll have ffmpeg installed in a non standart directory you'll may have to use PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable like this:

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/ffmpeg/lib/ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to//ffmpeg/lib/pkgconfig/ go build
```

## Settings

Default Settings can be alternated via config files in JSON format, there are 3 directories in which the config can be saved:

`/etc/mt/`, `$HOME/.mt/` and the current working directory

just create a file called `mt.json` in any of this locations to change the settings

to change settings on runtime you can either use the provided pflags (use `mt --help` for more info) or set environment Variables with the `MT_` prefix:

`mt --numcaps=20 myvideo.mkv` will change the numcaps settings to 20 for this run only, so will `MT_NUMCAPS=20 mt myvideo.mkv`

since v 1.0.3-dev there is an option to save the current settings to a specified config file:

`mt --save-config=/path/to/config.json`

and load a custom config on runtime:

`mt --config-file=/path/to/config.json`

## Available Config Options:

| name | default value | description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |

| overwrite | false | by default mt will increment the filename by adding -01 if there is already a jpg use --overwrite to overwrite the image instead |
| fast | false | makes mt faster a lot, but seeking will be more inacurate and may produce duplicate screens |
| webvtt | false | create a webvtt file for use with html5 video players |
| interval | 0 | creates a screencap every interval seconds, this overwrites numcaps |
| skip_credits | false | try to skip movie credits by cutting of 4 minutes or 10% of the length |

please note that all those values are also available as runtime pflags just replace the `_` with an `-` ex: `single_images` will get `single-images`

## Usage

just run `mt` and provide any video file as args:
`mt video.avi`

Some of the settings can be changed through runtime flags provided directly to `mt` for more information just run `mt --help`
